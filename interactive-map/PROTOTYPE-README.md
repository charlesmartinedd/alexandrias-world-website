## 🎯 Key Design Choices

### Why "Flip Book" Style?
- **Familiar** to kids (like reading a real book)
- **Clear progress** with page numbers
- **Simple navigation** (just two buttons)
- **Focus on content** (one page at a time)

### Kid-Friendly Elements

### Performance Optimizations Needed
⚠️ **Current**: Images are 2-2.7MB each (PNG)
✅ **Recommended**:
- Compress to ~200KB (use tools like TinyPNG)
- Convert to WebP format (better compression)
- Add lazy loading for better performance

## 🎨 Customization Points

### Colors (in modal-storybook.css)
```css
Primary gradient: #667eea to #764ba2  /* Purple */
Accent color: #FFD700                 /* Gold */
Button color: #FF7F50 to #FF6347      /* Coral Orange */
Success color: #90EE90 to #32CD32     /* Green */
```

### Adding More Countries
1. Create folder: `countries/[country-name]/`
2. Add images: `images/page_01.png` through `page_14.png`
3. Create `story.json` with:
   ```json
   {
     "country": "Brazil",
     "countryCode": "BR",
     "flag": "🇧🇷",
     "pages": [...]
   }
   ```
4. Update JavaScript to handle new country code
