✅ **Images on GitHub**: Confirmed (all 56 images uploaded)
✅ **Paths Correct**: `countries/japan/images/page_01_cover.png`

## 🐛 Why You're Seeing "Cover image loading..."

The most likely reasons:

### 1. **CDN Propagation Delay** ⏱️
- GitHub Pages uses a CDN (Content Delivery Network)
- New images can take **1-5 minutes** to propagate globally
- **Solution**: Wait 2-3 minutes and refresh

### 2. **Browser Cache** 💾
- Your browser cached the old version without images
- **Solution**: Hard refresh with `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

### 3. **Deployment Timing** 🚀
- The site HTML deployed before the images finished uploading
- **Solution**: The latest build (commit 45d6104) includes all images - just refresh!

---

## ✅ Quick Fix Steps:

### Step 1: Hard Refresh Browser
```
Windows: Ctrl + Shift + R
Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
```

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache
**Chrome/Edge:**
1. Press `F12` to open DevTools
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

**Firefox:**
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete`
2. Select "Cache" only
3. Click "Clear Now"

### Step 3: Test Direct Image URL
Open this in a new tab:
```
https://charlesmartinedd.github.io/alexandrias-world-website/book-viewer/countries/japan/images/page_01_cover.png
```

If you see the Japan cover image = Images are working! ✅

### Step 4: Revisit Site
```

```

## 🔍 Verify Images Are Loading:

### Method 1: Browser DevTools
1. Open your site
2. Press `F12` (DevTools)
3. Go to **Network** tab
4. Click on Japan (or any country)
5. Look for image requests
6. Check if they're loading (green = success, red = fail)

### Method 2: Direct URL Test
Test each country's cover image directly:

**Japan**:
```
https://charlesmartinedd.github.io/alexandrias-world-website/book-viewer/countries/japan/images/page_01_cover.png
```

**Brazil**:
```
https://charlesmartinedd.github.io/alexandrias-world-website/book-viewer/countries/brazil/images/page_01_cover.png
```

**France**:
```
https://charlesmartinedd.github.io/alexandrias-world-website/book-viewer/countries/france/images/page_01_cover.png
```

**Egypt**:
```

```

## 🚨 If Images Still Don't Load:

### Check 1: Verify Path in Browser
Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab
Look for errors like:
- "404 Not Found" = Path is wrong
- "Failed to load resource" = CDN delay
- "CORS error" = Cross-origin issue (shouldn't happen)

### Check 2: Test From Different Device
- Try from your phone
- Try from incognito/private mode
- Try from different browser

### Check 3: GitHub Pages URL Structure
Make sure you're visiting:
```
https://charlesmartinedd.github.io/alexandrias-world-website/book-viewer/
```

NOT:
```
https://charlesmartinedd.github.io/book-viewer/  ❌ Wrong!
```

---

## 🔧 Manual Path Debugging:

If images still won't load, let's check the exact path being requested:

### In book-data.js:
```javascript
// Current path function:
return `countries/${book.folder}/images/${pageFile}`;

// For Japan cover:
// Should resolve to: countries/japan/images/page_01_cover.png
```

### From index.html location:
- index.html is at: `/book-viewer/index.html`
- Image path: `countries/japan/images/page_01_cover.png`
- Full URL: `/book-viewer/countries/japan/images/page_01_cover.png`
- GitHub Pages URL: `https://charlesmartinedd.github.io/alexandrias-world-website/book-viewer/countries/japan/images/page_01_cover.png`

---

## 💡 Alternative Fix: Use Absolute Paths

If relative paths keep failing, we can change to absolute paths:

**Edit book-data.js**:
```javascript
// Change from:
return `countries/${book.folder}/images/${pageFile}`;

// To:
return `/alexandrias-world-website/book-viewer/countries/${book.folder}/images/${pageFile}`;
```

This ensures the path always starts from the GitHub Pages root.

## ⏱️ Timeline for Fix:

| Time | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| **Now** | Hard refresh browser | Should see images if CDN is ready |
| **+2 min** | CDN propagation | Images definitely available globally |
| **+5 min** | All caches cleared | 100% working for everyone |
